## Snaptics Software Overview

The Snaptics platform currently does not offer a software package to accompany the electronics and hardware. Snaptics has been designed using a SparkFun ESP32 Development board to allow users to easily connect Snaptics to their desired application. 

For a basic tutorial of the capabilities of the microcontroller, please consult the [Sparkfun ESP32 Thing Hookup Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/esp32-thing-hookup-guide#introduction). 

For pin assignments from the microcontroller to the Snaptics PCB board please check out our [Electronics Page](www.snaptics.org/electronics).

## Template Code - Under Construction
We are still working on our software page including full Snaptics example projects with template code.  Please check back here at a later date!
